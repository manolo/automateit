  # Backup +sources+ if they exist. Returns the names of the backups created.
  #
  # Options:
  # * :quiet -- Don't display output? Default is false.
  #
  # These backups are copies of the original sources saved into the same
  # directories as the originals. The pathnames of these copies are timestamped
  # and guaranteed to be unique, so you can have multiple backups of the same
  # sources.
  #
  # *WARNING*: This method is not conditional. It will make a backup every time
  # it's called if the sources exist. Therefore, only execute this method when
  # its needed.
  #
  # For example, backup a file:
  #
  #   backup("/tmp/myfile") # => "/tmp/myfile.1190994237_M2xhLrC6Sj.bak
  #
  # In the above example, the backup's name contains two special strings. The
  # "1190994237" is the time the backup was made in seconds since the Epoch.
  # The "M2xhLrC6Sj" is a random string used to guarantee the uniqueness of
  # this backup in case two are made at exactly the same time.
  def backup(*sources) dispatch(*sources) end

  # Execute a shell command.
  # Returns true for success and false for failure.
  def sh(*commands) dispatch(*commands) end
    
  # Execute a shell command.
  # It raises an exception with the execution output of the command in the case of failure.
  # It returns the command output in the case of success.
  def sys(*commands) dispatch(*commands) end

  # What is the path for this command? Returns +nil+ if command isn't found.
  #
  # Example:
  #   which("ls") # => "/bin/ls"
  def which(command) dispatch(command) end

  # Same as #which but throws an ArgumentError if command isn't found.
  def which!(command) dispatch(command) end

  # Creates a temporary file. Optionally takes a +name+ argument which is
  # purely cosmetic, e.g., if the +name+ is "foo", the routine may create a
  # temporary file named <tt>/tmp/foo_qeKo7nJk1s</tt>.
  #
  # When called with a block, invokes the block with the path of the temporary
  # file and deletes the file at the end of the block.
  #
  # Without a block, returns the path of the temporary file and you're
  # responsible for removing it when done.
  def mktemp(name=nil, &block) # :yields: path
    dispatch(name, &block)
  end

  # Creates a temporary directory. See #mktemp for details on the +name+
  # argument.
  #
  # When called with a block, invokes the block with the path of the
  # temporary directory and recursively deletes the directory and its
  # contents at the end of the block.
  #
  # Without a block, returns the path of the temporary directory and you're
  # responsible for removing it when done.
  #
  # CAUTION: Read notes at the top of ShellManager for potentially
  # problematic situations that may be encountered if using this command in
  # preview mode!
  def mktempdir(name=nil, &block) # :yields: path
    dispatch(name, &block)
  end

  # Same as #mktempdir but performs a #cd into the directory for the duration
  # of the block.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   puts pwd # => "/home/bubba"
  #   mktempdircd do |path|
  #     puts path # => "/tmp/tempster_qeKo7nJk1s"
  #     puts pwd  # => "/tmp/tempster_qeKo7nJk1s"
  #   end
  #   puts File.exists?("/tmp/tempster_qeKo7nJk1s") # => false
  def mktempdircd(name=nil, &block) # :yields: path
    dispatch(name, &block)
  end

  # Change the permissions of the +targets+. This command is like the #chmod
  # and #chown in a single command.
  #
  # Options:
  # * :recursive -- Change files and directories recursively. Defaults to false.
  # * :user -- User name to change ownership to.
  # * :group -- Group name to change ownership to.
  # * :mode -- Mode to use as octal, e.g., <tt>0400</tt> to make a file
  #   readable only to its owner.
  # * :details -- Reports the files modified, rather than the arguments
  #   modified. An argument might be a single directory, but this may result in
  #   modifications to many files within that directory. Use :details for
  #   situations when there's a need to see all files actually changed. The
  #   reason :details is off by default is that it will flood the screen with a
  #   list of all files modified in a large directory, which is overwhelming
  #   and probably unnecessary unless you actually need to see these details.
  #   Defaults to false.
  def chperm(targets, opts={}) dispatch(targets, opts) end

  # Set the umask to +mode+. If given a block, changes the umask only for the
  # duration of the block and changes it back to its previous setting at the
  # end.
